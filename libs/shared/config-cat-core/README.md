# ConfigCat Core

The core implementation of ConfigCat providers.
This is a shared core package. Application developers should use one of the more specific providers instead:

- For web/browser applications, use [@openfeature/config-cat-web-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfeature/config-cat-web-provider).
- For server-side (Node.js) applications, use [@openfeature/config-cat-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfeature/config-cat-provider).
