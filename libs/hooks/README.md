# OpenFeature JavaScript Hooks

Hooks are a mechanism whereby application developers can add arbitrary behavior to flag evaluation. They operate similarly to middleware in many web frameworks. Please see the [spec](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/specification/sections/hooks) for more details.

## Add a new hook

1.  `npm ci`
1.  `npm run generator-hook`
