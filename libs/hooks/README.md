# OpenFeature JavaScript Hooks

Hooks are a mechanism whereby application developers can add arbitrary behavior to flag evaluation. They operate similarly to middleware in many web frameworks. Please see the [spec](https://github.com/open-feature/spec/blob/main/specification/sections/04-hooks.md) for more details.

## Add a new hook

1.  `npm ci`
1.  `npm run generator-hook`
