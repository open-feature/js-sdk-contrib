# Add {my-system} provider

## Reasoning

I want to add an OpenFeature provider for {my-system}. This would be valuable because...

- everybody uses {my-system}!
- {my system} supports {these things}!
- other reasons!

## Requirements:

- [ ] generate provider via [tooling](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-module)
- [ ] implement `Provider` interface
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] complete README
- [ ] add the new provider to the [OpenFeature docs](https://github.com/open-feature/docs.openfeature.dev/issues/new/choose)
