# Add {my-behavior} hook

## Reasoning

I want to add a hook which performs {my-behavior}.

- it would be great if {my-behavior} could be included in some flag evaluations 
- {my-behavior} would enable developers to be more productive!
- other reasons!

## TODO:

- [ ] generate hook via [tooling](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-module)
- [ ] implement `Hook` interface
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] complete README

Keep in mind the CONTRIBUTING guidelines: https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
